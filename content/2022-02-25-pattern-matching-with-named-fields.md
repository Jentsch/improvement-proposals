# Summary

With the first [first SIP ever named and default arguments](https://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/named-and-default-arguments.html) a feature disparity between case class constructors and case class deconstructors was introduced. This was an long outstanding issue. (for example https://github.com/scala/bug/issues/6524)

This SIP introduces a readable, extensible, and intuitive way to deconstruct case classes in pattern matching.

A WIP PR can be found here: https://github.com/Jentsch/dotty

This SIP is for now structured in three sections: 
Motivation to visualize the desired outcome. 
Desgin to enumarate all goals and constrains for this SIP.
Encoding describe how the design can be implemented, focused on the encoding choosen in the PR.

# Motivating

Given one wants to use pattern matching on a case class:

```scala
case class User(name: String, age: Int, city: String)

val user = User(name = "Anna", age = 10, city = "Berlin")

val annasCity = user match
  case User(name = "Anna", city = c) => c
```

The Deconstruction allows the same syntax as the construction and seems to be what people intuitively expect. See for example the very first post in [Scala Contributors Thread][contributors-thread] for this topic.

Without names in patterns, users have to use underscore a lot. The example above would be written as:

//TODO: how often does this pattern occur?

```scala
val annasCity = user match
  case User("Anna", _, c) => c
```

This makes it hard to see which parameter means what. The same issue led to named arguments. Adding underscores until the compiler is happy is also not a great experience. IDEs help here, by showing the names.

Additionally, the code breaks every time a field of `User` gets added, rearranged, or removed.
In the best case, the broken patterns fail to compile and needs to fixed manually.
In the worst case, a pattern breaks silently, if two fields with the same type switch places.

My personal motivation comes from using [`matchPattern` in ScalaTest](https://www.scalatest.org/user_guide/using_matchers#matchingAPattern)
and got bitten by it every time my data model changed slightly.

# Design

The goal is to allow named parameter in deconstruction as in construction.

## Mixed usage

Mixed patterns, with positional and named patterns are allowed to keep the similarity.
But they have no motivational use case. Maybe they should be disallowed.

```scala
  case User("Anna", city = c) => // Mixed usage seems wired
  case User(_, city = c) => // Leading underscore are especially useless
```

## Disallow same name twice

```scala
  case User(city = city1, city = city2) => a // error city is used twice
  case User(name1, name = name2) => a // error name is used twice
```

The same should happen if the `User` had a field with a [deprecated name](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/deprecatedName.html).

## Order of name and term

Normally, an equal sign assigns the result of the right side to the left side. With the proposed syntax, that's not the case. However, for most, if not all, people that's the correct order.

This order seems to require a single look ahead in the parser.

## Ignoring of unused parameters

To allow case class to become more extensible, all unused parameters should be ignored. So when a field is added to the cases class old patterns stay source compatible.

```scala
  case User(city = "Paris") => // is the same as
  case User(_, _, "Paris") =>
```

## Syntax

## Desugaring

> One important principle of Scalaâ€™s pattern matching design is that case classes should be abstractable. I.e. we want to be able to represent the abilities of a case class without exposing the case class itself. That also allows code to evolve from a case class to a regular class or a different case class while maintaining the interface of the old case class. [Martin Odersky](https://contributors.scala-lang.org/t/pattern-matching-with-named-fields/1829/52)

* Allow the same feature of case classes:
  * Provide arbitrary names
  * Enable [`@deprecatedName`](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/deprecatedName.html), which leads to multiple names for a single field. Using both should be an error.
* Maybe provide additional named fields. For example for our `User`:

  ```scala
  case User(ageInDays = 3650) => ...
  ```

  But this could be an awful feature.
* Maybe leave fields without names

# Encoding

This SIP proposes basically to use [shapeless records](https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless/wiki/Feature-overview:-shapeless-2.0.0#extensible-records) for the specific purpose of pattern matching.
For an incomplete list of alternatives, see [alternative desugaring](#alternative-desugaring) below.

Pro:

* with shapeless records we have a good understanding what we are doing, however we need to tweak the encoding a bit
* with some helper definitions, the usage could be quite short
* reuse possible

Con:

* opens a can of worms, as this encoding could be useful for other requested features like [named tuples](named-tuple), which would require more thought-out design
* no support for `@deprecatedName`
* identifiers are represented with string literals
* no meaningful way to use names within variadic patterns 
  (the encoding enforces to use the names in order. A name like `last` in `Seq` could be implemented with this encoding.)

Example for an extractor using option and tuple:

```scala
object User:
  def unapply(user: User): Option[
    (String, Int, String) & 
    { type Names = ("name", "age", "city") }
  ] = Some((user.name, user.age, user.city)).asInstanceOf[
      Option[(String, Int, String) & { type Names = ("name", "age", "city") }]
    ]
```

Example for an name based extractor:

```scala
object User:
  def unapply(user: User) = MyUserExtractor(user)

class UserExtractor(user: User) extends Product:
  def _1: String = user.name
  def _2: Int = user.age
  def _3: String = user.city
  type Names = ("name", "age", "city")
  ...
```
The `Names` can be pulled either direcly from the return type of the `unapply` method, for name based extractors, or from the type of the returned `Option`. (The case where no tuple, but just a single type is return, e.g. `Option[Int]`, also can be expressed as `Option[Int & { Names = ("age") }]`.)

The reason to pull the names out, instead of keeping them near to their type, is to prevent extractors to accidentally leaking the name.

## Implementation

If a pattern with a name is encountered, the compiler looks up the list of provided names and places the trees accordingly.

The list of names either provided by the return type of the unapply method or by the constructor list of the case class.

Example:

```scala
// a match clause like
case User(<tree1>, city = <tree2>) => ???

// gets rewritten to:
case User(
  <tree1>, // because tree1 is positional pattern
  _, // because name isn't mentioned
  <tree2>, // because city is the third parameter of user
)
```

This allows us to gloss over the details of how pattern matching gets desugared further down the line.

## Drawbacks

### Allow skipping arguments

Whenever a single named argument is used in a pattern, the pattern can have fewer arguments than the unapply provides. This is driven by the motivation to make pattern matching extensible.
But this leads to (arguably small) inconsistency, as pointed out by Lionel Parreaux in the [Scala Contributors Thread](https://contributors.scala-lang.org/t/pattern-matching-with-named-fields/1829/44). This could lead users to use a named pattern, just to skip all parameters.

```scala
  case User(age = _) => "Just wanted to use the extractor, lol!"
```

### Reordering of user code


```scala
//TODO: Test this
object User:
  class UserExtractor(user: User):
    def _1 = println("Got name"); user.name
    def _2 = println("Got age"); user.age
    def _3 = println("Got city"); user.city

    type Names = ("name", "age", "city")
// Ask for city, then for name
val User(city = _, name = _) = user
// But the execution shows:
// Got name
// Got age
// Got city
```

## Alternatives

### Without any changes to the language

One alternative way of archiving most objectives, that is doable with current Scala, is to use specialized extractors.

```scala
object User:
  object age:
    def unapply(user: User): Option[Int] =
      Some(user.age)

user match
  case User.age(y) => y
```

Libraries like [Monocle][monocle] could be extended to reduce the boilerplate, but some boilerplate would remain.
In addition, this breaks the intuitive similarity between construction and deconstruction.

### Alternative desugaring

As the above described desugaring has its drawbacks. Here are some alternatives with other drawbacks, and maybe better trade-offs.

#### Use underscore methods

In the spirit of [name based pattern matching](https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/changed-features/pattern-matching.html#name-based-match):

```scala
object User:
  class UserMatching(user: User):
    def _1 = user.name
    def _name = user.name

    @deprecatedName
    def _oldName = user.name.toUpperCase
    ...
  
  def unapply(user: User) = UserMatching(user)
```

Pro:

* have more named fields than positional fields
* allows `@deprecatedName`
* enabled meaningful names in variadic patterns
* lazy evaluation patterns where bad field could have type `Nothing` or would throw could, but the pattern would match, as long the bad field isn't mentioned. (This would have many consequences)
* It's easy to add extractors for maps in another SIP. At least on the encoding side.

Con:

* How to detect that a name means the same as a position? Maybe detect simple patterns like the last line in the example?
* It's long and verbose, without any shortcuts in sight.
* An underscore at the beginning of a name isn't an unheard of pattern, even in Scala. This could accidentally expose fields, which weren't supposed to become fields.

#### Annotated `unapply` method

```scala
object User:
  @names("name", "age", "city")
  def unapply(user: User): Some[(String, Age, String)] = ...
```

Pro:

* simple to implement (was done in the first draft implementation)

Con:

* no clear way of encoding deprecated name
* annotations are not very scalaish
* no reuse possible

#### Add type as vehicle

```scala
object User:
  type Unapply = ("name", "age", "city")
  def unapply(user: User): Some((String, Age, String)) = ...
```

Pro:

* should be easy to implement
* the type and the method can inherit from traits and allow some kind of reuse

Con:

* the type and the method can be defined in unrelated traits. Only at the use site of the can be checked if the type and the method agree on the arity of the pattern.
* no clear way of encoding deprecated name

### Partial destructuring in guards

Lionel Parreaux proposed a more powerful mechanism, where if guards of cases could them self contains destructuring patterns.

```scala
  case user: User if Age(years) <- user.age => years
  case User(age = Age(years)) => years // both cases do the same thing
```

His proposal is strictly more powerful, but arguably less intuitive. Both, pattern matching with named fields and Partial destructuring in guards could be implemented along each other. Named fields for simple patterns and destructuring in guards for complex patterns. However, they offer two ways to do the same thing and could lead to lots of bike shedding, if both got added to the language.
